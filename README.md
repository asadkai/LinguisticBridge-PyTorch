# transformer-pytorch
This is a machine translation project using **Transformer** introduced in *Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., ... & Polosukhin, I. (2017). Attention is all you need. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 5998-6008)*.



I used English-French corpus provided by "European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus 1996-2011", cited in publication *Koehn, P. (2005, September). Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation. In MT summit (Vol. 5, pp. 79-86)*.

(The size of the data was so large that only 50000 samples were used for convenience.)
